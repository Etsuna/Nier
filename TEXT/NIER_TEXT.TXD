1800600	What's my favorite flower?
1800700	Who do I love more than anyone?
1830000	Let's see what work I've got for you today...
1830100	Which job should I give you first?
1830200	Doesn't look like I have any work for you right now. Come back next time you're free, okay?
1830300	Come back next time you're free, okay?
1830400	I wrote down the client's location on your map, so head over there to get the details.
1830500	Wait, you don't have a map? Ah, well. Just ask the client for the details.
1830600	Oh, you want a different job?
1830700	I think Popola's still suffering from that stupid cold. 
Can you go check on her for me?
1830800	Hey, the gatekeeper needs some kind of message delivered.
The guy never leaves his post, so maybe you can help him out?
1830900	Popola said she's got a job for you.
She really depends on you, doesn't she!
1831000	Seems there's a villager with a job for you.
It's about chickens, or...something. I don't know, details bore me.<PAGE>Anyway, just go ask the client for details.
1831100	Boy, the ladies just can't get enough of you! I heard another one's looking for some help.
Something to do with mutton, I think.
1831200	Seems like the florist's looking for help.
I guess she needs something from Seafront.
1831300	I heard someone needs help organizing books.
Popola's too busy to handle it herself, so do you mind helping out?
1831400	The lady who runs the tavern needs some help.
That's the girl with the really strung-out grandmother.
1831500	Sounds like someone's got a problem on their hands.
They burned their kitchen to the ground! Not too smart...
1831600	The florist has a request.
Sounds like she needs some shopping done.
1831700	Um... Well, this is a little weird. It's from Yonah.
Go home and check on her, will you? I think she's lonely.
1831800	Someone wants you to collect an item from The Aerie.
Yeah, go ask the client for more details. I kind of dozed off during that part.
1831900	There's a parcel that needs to be delivered to The Aerie.
Some kind of repayment or honor debt or...you know. Something.
1832000	I've got a request from a woman here.
I guess she needs parts to repair the waterwheel. Maybe you can help her out?
1832100	Apparently, the fountain in the village square is breaking down.
Think you could go check it out? Please? For me?
1832200	I've got another delivery request here.
Something about a fragile parcel that needs to go to Seafront.
1832300	An old-timer in Seafront is looking for help.
...Sorry, but that's all I know. Oh, and he said he knows you.
1832400	That old fisherman's got another job for you.
You guys are getting pretty close, huh?
1832500	A shipbuilder in Seafront needs some help.
He needs materials for a repair job. Why don't you go check it out?
1832600	The old fisherman has another request.
I had no idea you liked fish so much!
1832700	That fisherman in Seafront's back with more work.
How's the fishing going, anyway? You must be getting good!
1832800	Guess what? ...C'mon, guess!<PAGE>Oh, fine. I'll tell you. It's another job from the fisherman.
Hey, at least you'll have plenty of fish to eat.
1832900	The old fisherman needs you again.
It's good to see you taking such an interest in the elderly.
1833000	Again? You guessed it—the Seafront fisherman's back.
Be careful out there. You wouldn't want to hook poor Weiss.
1833100	Surprise, surprise. The old fisherman's calling...
Blah blah blah, right? You know the deal by now.
1833200	The Seafront fisherman said this next job could cost both of you your lives!
I figure he's just being melodramatic, but it's still kinda spooky.
1833300	Heya! The Seafront tavern's in need of assistance.
...Maybe I should take this one. I bet they've got quite a selection!
1833400	Want a job from the tavern keeper in Seafront?<PAGE>He wants to talk to you about a new dish or something.
You're like a celebrity, aren't you!
1833500	Special delivery! From you, to Facade. Sound good?
By the way, how'd you even get in that place?
1833600	I've got a job from Facade, fresh off the grill!
You certainly know a lot of people, don't you? You're a real mover and shaker, <NIER>!
1833700	Someone in Facade asked for your help.
...Are they tough to deal with? Because they seem like total weirdos.
1833800	Facade's looking for help again.
The king needs materials for something. ...And he's a king, so you better hop to it!
1833900	...What the heck?
Okay... Apparently someone in Facade wants you to fix his broken marriage.
1834000	A Facade resident is looking for help.
It's something about flowers, or something like that.
1834100	The tavern keeper in Seafront needs your help.
I think he's looking for food again. ...Guy must be really hungry!
1834200	Wanna help out the village blacksmith?
Um...I don't have much. The request is a bit vague.
1834300	I got a request from the government of Facade!
You're like our town's ambassador or something!
1834400	Hey, look. Yonah's looking for help.
Better make it a top priority, mister!
1834500	A Seafront resident has a letter for you to deliver.
Maybe you should just become a postman?
1834600	Someone lost their dog.
...No job too small, huh?
1834700	Some guy in Seafront wants to become a big-time trader.
Whatever works, I guess. He's waiting by the port over there.
1834800	I heard from a man who wants you to track down his son.
It's a little weird, though. The kid is actually a grown man.
1834900	Oh, brother. This one's rich.
Some guy wants to give a gift to a woman, and he needs your help.
1835000	I've got an urgent job from Facade.
Some poor girl's gone missing! You should get over there right away and help them out.
1835100	Facade's got a request.
Apparently they need you to put the hurt on some bandits. It's about time they gave you some real work!
1835200	Wanna go to Seafront?<PAGE>I've got a request from a lady there. Actually, it's more like a demand.
Geez, I wish I could boss people around like this!
1835300	Seems like there's a traveler in Seafront who's searching for something. 
Why don't you go see what she wants?
1835400	Guess what? It's another job from Facade.
Some young man. ...And that's all I know.
1835500	There's a request here from a shopkeeper.
Apparently he's having trouble with thieves.<PAGE>...Stupid thieves! Go give 'em what-for!
1835600	That trader in Seafront has another request.
Well, he's more of a would-be trader, I guess. ...Anyway, he can fill you in.
1835700	The wife of one of the village shopkeepers needs help. I guess her kid is really sick. 
...I probably don't need to ask you twice about this one, huh?
1835800	There's a woman here in the village looking for her boyfriend.
She should just go look for herself! ...But hey, she's paying, so I'll shut up.
1835900	Seems there's a man looking for a rather unique piece of cutlery.
He says he'll pay whatever it takes. ...Oooo! How exciting!
1836000	Got a job from Seafront, if you aren't too busy.
It's a guy. Looking for something.<PAGE>...Um, yeah. Just go ask him, all right?
1836100	That butler from the manor needs your help.
You sure do keep some strange company...
1836200	Apparently there're Shades in the village? Eeeek!
Well!? Don't just stand there! Go take care of them!
1836300	The florist in Seafront has a job for you.
Just a simple delivery. Easy-peasy.
1836400	Someone in the Forest of Myth wanted your assistance.
That's the first job I've gotten from there in...well, as long as I can remember.
1836500	A villager was attacked by Shades in the northern plains.
Can you go ask him about it? It may be something we should look into.
1836600	A postman wants you to get rid of some Shades.
It's getting pretty dangerous around here lately.
1836700	I have a job from the manor's butler.
He says there's a "unique" Shade he wants your advice on.<PAGE>Yeah, don't look at me...
1836800	Hey, there's a scholar in Seafront who asked about you.
I guess he needs help with historical research?
1836900	Another guy in Facade wanted your help with something.
I tell ya, if it wasn't for you, that whole city would just fall apart.
1837000	I got a letter from the king of Facade.
He said he needs you to deal with an "issue." Wonder what that's about?
1837100	One of the villagers is having problems with a wild boar.
Those boars can be a real handful. Maybe you could help out?
1837200	I've got a job from the postman in Seafront.
He needs your help with a personal matter.
1837300	I've got another job from that Seafront postman.
Apparently some cranky old lady is giving him trouble.
1837400	I got a letter from the Seafront postman.
Apparently he has a message for you. How mysterious!
1837500	Something's up over in the Junk Heap.
I'm worried about the kid who runs Two Brothers Weaponry. Could you give him a visit?
1837700	I have a job from Facade. 
Somebody's worried about his son.

I hope you're doing okay. I'm doing fine here,
though it gets kind of lonely sometimes.
But whenever that happens, I just look up at the sky and
wonder if it's the same color wherever you are, too.
That usually makes me feel better.

Don't catch cold, okay?

Yonah

on my disease, and whenever I think about how upset you are,
it makes me kind of sad.

I wish you'd slow down a little and not worry about me,
because seeing you in pain is way worse than this stupid Black Scrawl.
I know that sounds weird, but it's the truth.

Yonah
2400200	Dear Brother,

Today was awesome! Popola made me this HUGE cake that was really
yummy, and everyone in the village has been wishing me happy birthday.
It's fun! I feel like a princess or something.

I don't feel sick at all today. In fact, I almost forgot I had this disease!
So maybe you can forget about it too and come back home now? 

Yonah
2400300	My dearest beloved,

Please forgive the lateness of this letter. I have recently fallen quite ill,
and had some difficulty finding a doctor in this foreign land.
The people here, however, have treated me with great kindness,
and I now feel my body getting stronger by the day.
If my recovery continues, I hope to attempt the journey home soon. 

I think about you every day, and yearn for the moment when
we can be together again. Please take care of yourself,
and know that I am doing everything I can to return to you.
2400400	My dearest beloved,

Again I put pen to paper when all I desire is to see you with my
own eyes. How do the days find you? I am faring well enough.
My illness is stubborn, but my love for you is stronger!
Just knowing that you wait for me is enough to keep me going. 

I know how lonely you must be, but I must say this again:
Do not attempt to find me. The voyage is treacherous, and disease
runs rampant in this land. If anything were to happen to you,
I fear I would not be able to take it.

My love. My dearest love. I will return to you soon.
2400500	My dearest beloved,

Fifty years have passed since I last gazed upon your face. How is it
possible? When next we meet, I hope you can look past the wrinkles
of an old man and see into a soul as young as the day we first met.

This passage of time has led me to think upon our earlier days. When we
first met, you were the prettiest girl in town. Your beauty was what first
attracted me to you, but it was your kind heart which ensnared my soul.
It gladdens me to read your letters, for I can see in them that your
spirit is as wonderful as ever. 

I thank the gods each day that we fell in love, even as I curse them
for keeping us apart. I will see you again. Wait for me, my love.
2400600	Dearest Popola,

I hope this letter finds you well.

I am writing in hopes of bringing to your attention a certain dream
issue of concern regarding recent events in dream the village.
I was hoping I might be dream able to get your advice dream
on the matter.

Recently there have been dream reports dream dream of a certain dream

2400700	Dear <NIER>,

I know we haven't spoken in a while, and I'm sorry that my first
communication is a plea for help, but I'm at my wit's end here.

I have an important letter that must be delivered to the woman in
the lighthouse, but the issues with my leg prevent me from bringing
it to her. I have asked my fellow postmen from other towns to help
me, but they all claim to be too busy. (Personally, I think they're
all just scared of the woman...and I suppose I can't blame them!)

You are the only man I can think of who can stand up to her.
Will you please come and help me?
It would mean more than you can know.
2400800	Dear <NIER>,

You've been fantastic! If I thought you were interested,
I'd make you a deputy postman on the spot!
But I'm sure you have more important matters to attend to.

Can you come to the post office in Seafront? I know it's
a bit of a trek, but I have something for you in the way
of a thank-you, and I would like to deliver it in person.
2400900	My good sir,

You do not know me, but rest assured, I know of you.
Tales of your exploits have spread far and wide across
the land, bringing hope to even the darkest corners.
Imagine, a man strong enough to stand against the Shades!
It makes my heart race just to think of it.

I know this seems sudden, but I would be most appreciative
if you could pay me a visit. I am the owner of a humble
manor located in the southern plains, but I promise you,
my hospitality is second to none! 

Please think upon my offer. I look forward to meeting you.
2401000	*IMPORTANT NOTICE*

Greetings from Two Brothers Weaponry! We hope that all of our loyal customers are doing well.

We're pleased to announce that the dust has settled, and our renovations are now complete!
Our new store is opening today, with even more great ways to serve the busy Shade hunter!

We apologize for any inconvenience caused by our lengthy closure, and we hope to see you soon.
2401100	Official Notice 

As per Rule 25,656, please consider this your official notice that the
king of Facade has chosen to enter into the ceremony of matrimony.
Please lodge all objections and/or congratulations through the
official channels stated in Rule 38,585.

Sincerely,

The Facade Royal Office of Marriage and Other Legally Binding
Contracts and Concerns

PS: Hey, guys, it's me! The king of Facade! Sorry this
is all formal and stuff. Listen, I'm getting married,
and I really want you to come!...So get over here!
2401200	Dear <NIER>

This is going to sound sudden, but I'm leaving the city soon.
I have some things I need to get straight in my head,
and I don't think I can do so here.

If anything happens to me, I'd like you to take care of my personal
affairs. Oh, and I haven't mentioned this to my advisor because I
wanted to tell you first. So if he seems really surprised, that's why.

See you soon,

—The king of Facade
2401300	Notice: Archival Storage   8.2.2026

Following the recent incident with Number 6, we have decided to
establish an archival room. This room will hold records on the
methods used to control and/or cancel all forms of magic—
including petrification and bestial transformation—as well as
allow other projects to move forward. (Specifically, this
should make it easier to complete a long-term storage solution
for Number 6, as well as proceed with our work on Number 7.)

All employees are required to keep the courtyard
entrance to this new room secure. Failure to do so
is considered grounds for immediate termination.
2401400	Notice: Progress Report on Number 6   12.25.2025

We have completed the initial research into Number 6, and are ready
to initiate the startup experiment in the coming days.

As this will likely mark a great leap forward in Gestalt research,
the National Weapons Research Laboratory has made the completion of
the Number 6 project its top priority. Budgets for all other
projects are to be frozen, effective immediately.
2401500	Notice: Meeting Agenda   9.12.2026

Today's meeting will address the following topics:
- A solution for long-term storage of Number 6.
- A progress report on Number 7.
- Disguising the laboratory's above-ground facility as a mansion.
2401600	Notice: Progress Report on Number 6   10.11.2025

The donor body Halua has been chosen from among the seven candidate
subjects to proceed to the next stage. In the interest of protecting state
secrets, all but one of the remaining subjects will be disposed of.
The donor body Emil, however, will be kept in storage as a failsafe
measure.
2401700	From: The Office of the Mayor of Seafront
To: The Chief of The Aerie

I hope my letter finds you in good spirits. That said, I have not
received correspondence from your village in some time. Is everything
well? Our merchants have lost contact with their customers from your
fair town, and this disquiets all of us greatly.

As you know, Shade activity has been on the rise as of late, and this
makes us fear for the safety of The Aerie—especially since the foul
creatures seem unusually attracted to your area. Please let us know
if there is anything that the people of Seafront can do to help in
the fight against this common enemy.
2401800	To: Two Brothers Weaponry

Allow us to extend our heartfelt thanks regarding our recent business
transaction. We hope you will forgive our initial reaction when we
learned of your youth. Such worries have proven to be totally unfounded,
as the metals we received were all of the utmost quality.
We could not be more satisfied with the order!

We hope to continue doing business in the future.

The Seafront Company, Trade Division
2401900	From: The Office of the Mayor of Seafront
To: Popola

I write to you regarding the urgent matter of The Aerie. As you know,
Shade activity in that area has been much increased of late, and we
now fear the worst. Numerous letters to the village chief have yet
to be returned, and our merchants have recently lost all contact
with customers there.

While Seafront has yet to be troubled by the Shades, we fear their
arrival is only a matter of time. I encourage your village to take
all necessary steps to defend yourself from this terrible scourge;
the loss of two outposts would be almost too much to bear.

I hope to hear from you soon.
2402000	My dearest,

My efforts at cultivating freesia have finally borne fruit!
I know it's taken a while, but I didn't want to contact
you until I was sure I could keep my head above water. 

Now that the money is starting to roll in, I was hoping you would leave
the village and come live with me as my wife. I know it's sudden,
but I'm not very good at this type of thing, so I figured I'd just
ask and let the chips fall where they may. 

I'll be waiting for you.
2402100	Hi, <NIER>!

Hey, it's me! Emil! Sorry I've been quiet for so long.
Are you and Weiss getting along all right? Is he still using
big words and making everyone feel dumb? I bet he is!

Anyway, I recently stumbled upon some records
that might help us in curing Kainé's petrification.
Would you mind coming here to take a look? 

Thanks! I'll be waiting!
2402200	Dear <NIER>,

This is to inform you that the upgrade work on your
weapon has been completed. The weapon is ready and
available for pickup at your earliest convenience.

I also have a more personal request to make of you, one I hope
we can discuss further once you arrive to pick up the weapon.

Yours,
Two Brothers Weaponry
2402300	From The Office of the Chief of The Aerie
To: Popola

My greetings to you and your village. I hope everything is going well.

Our village has shut itself away from the world for far too many years,
and we have therefore decided it is time to change our ways. As part of
this endeavor, we have resolved to establish a shop within the village.
It is now open for business, and I look forward to seeing a great many
customers visit from all over the world.

With regards to the "sacrifice" keyword you wrote about, one of our
villagers claimed to know the meaning behind the term. You are more
than welcome to speak with him on the matter as part of your visit
to The Aerie.

I hope to hear again from you soon.
2403200	Project Gestalt Report 0923

As noted in the previous report, implementation of Gestalt mode can
prevent the white chlorination syndrome we recently experienced.
Transfer of bodily information to civilization-repressed Replicants
is proceeding as planned, with the genes of the Originals safely
stored inside.

Our role as surveillance androids to prepare for when the
incurable bacterial disease eventually dies out is also underway.
So far, this is proceeding without issue.

Observer: 021   Codename: Popola
2403300	Project Gestalt Report 9182

This document discusses potential strategies for the relapse cases
we have observed in recent years. The term "relapse," of course,
refers to the catastrophic loss of sentience seen in certain Gestalts.
This syndrome has defied even our most pessimistic initial estimates,
and continues to trend upward with disturbing speed.

With some relapsed Gestalts beginning to attack Replicants,
there is an urgent need to take comprehensive action.
We remain convinced that an unknown technological defect in the
Gestalt transformation process is responsible for the condition,
but so far have been unable to confirm this theory.

Research of this condition is now our top priority,
and looks likely to continue for some time.

Shorthand Minutes of Case 23 (Emergency Response Conference)
Committee Special Meeting

Issue: Observed upward trend in relapses
(noted and discussed).
Issue: Acceleration of restoration schedule (approved).
Report: Debate over using codename "Noir" for human restoration schedule.
Report: Preparations to launch "Weiss" decoding system for above.
Report: Order collection of guidance and release code for
<NIER> alongside Weiss launch.

Observer: 021   Codename: Popola

2403500	Project Gestalt Report 11242

We have determined that the rise of relapses was due to an unexpected
spike in the sentience of Replicants, as well as a genetic instability
within the original Gestalt. (It seems the Original's effect on bodies
that have undergone the Gestalt process was not anticipated in advance.)

Immediate action must be undertaken to identify the links between
this trend and the original Gestalt—along with its sister,
the relapsed case known as Yonah.

The Observer Contact Group is growing uneasy, so finding a
solution to the relapse issue should be considered a top priority.

I hope you're doing okay. I'm doing fine here,

But whenever that happens, I just look up at the sky and
wonder if it's the same color wherever you are, too.
That usually makes me feel better.

3220000	A simple sword forged by a village smith. 
More suited to fending off small animals than actual combat.
3220100	A ceremonial blade crafted from feathers of the legendary
firebird. It is untested as a weapon.
3220200	A sword that bears a beastly motif. Its short, thin blade seems
eager to vanish from sight.
3220300	Forged from steel and liquefied beast fangs, the blade is red
with the blood of countless sacrificial offerings. 
3220400	A sword created after a man, driven mad by revenge, sealed
away a cursed dragon.
3220500	An ancient warlord used this sword to slay his loyal subjects
in hopes of gaining eternal life.
3220600	A unique sword with a round blade. Legend holds that it robs
the wielder of his life force.
3220700	Made from the fossil of an ancient beast. It's more unwieldy
than most swords—but further forging can help.
3220800	A group of girls used this sword to consecrate a newly-built
temple with their own blood.
3220900	A weapon owned by a blind swordsman. The blade shines in
darkness, making the owner easy to spot.

blade becomes blunt as wood.
3221100	A narrow sword once owned by a woman of such impossible
beauty that men begged her to take their lives.
3221200	A sword carried by the world's most loyal servant. Like that
loyalty, the sword's blade is straight and true.
3221300	A relic of the civilized age. Its rusty scent comes from the
blood of all who dared oppose the wielder.

3222100	A large sword used by temple guardsmen, and supposedly
made from feathers of the legendary firebird.
3222200	A beastly sword whose keen edge stands ready to mow down
all who question the divine right of the wielder.

glow lures people deep into the labyrinth.

to save the world.
3222500	A giant, accursed axe that was bathed in the blood of young twins
before being presented to the gods themselves.
3222600	A man's dementia drove him to attack his daughter's fiancé
with this axe. Sadly, he hit his daughter instead.
3222700	A mage with a putrid soul imbued the essence of a fire lizard
into this axe.

blood and flesh cling to the blade.

spear is filled with a deep hatred for the world.

3224500	The favorite spear of a mad queen whose lust for power led
her to kill all of her sons' wives.
3224600	This spear's point is so finely honed that all who are grazed
by it experience an instant, painless death.

Got a letter from Brother today! He's in a far-away town
where he can see the ocean. I hope I can see the
ocean someday. I bet it's huge!
11920100	June 6

Today is Brother's birthday, but he's not here. So I just
had a party by myself!
11920200	July 20

Devola and Popola came to keep me company today.
They even sang a song for me! It was really great!
I need to practice so I can sing to Brother when he gets back.
11920300	October 28

I was tired today, so I stayed home and hid in bed.
I could still hear Devola singing from somewhere, though.
Listening to her always makes me happy.
11920400	December 1

Today Popola sent me a new book about a great big tree.
I really hope it has a happy ending. There's nothing
worse than a sad tree. 
11920500	January 30

Brother came back! He came back home to see me!
Yaaaay, Brother!
11920600	February 4

I'm gonna learn to make awesome food for Brother.
I better start working on a new secret recipe.
11920700	March 16

The boy who's always running around outside gave me a
super pretty flower today! I wonder if Popola knows what
it's called?
11920800	August 31

The village is buzzing with excitement and stuff today.
I dunno what happened, but Devola told me not to worry.
At first I thought it was a festival, but now I don't know.
11920900	May 4

I write Brother letters every single day. He always worries
about me, but I feel fine.
11921000	September 21

I wish I could meet the Kainé lady Brother told me about.
I bet she's really nice and always says nice things.

I wonder if that's what my mom was like?
11921100	December 22

The snow won't stop falling, so Brother said he'd stay here
with me until it stops. He'll probably leave again when
it does, so I kinda hope it snows forever.
11930000	April 5

Whenever I read a letter from Brother, I really feel like I need
to see him again.
11930100	June 6

Brother said he'd come home for my birthday, but I wanna
celebrate his birthday once in a while!
11930200	July 20

Devola and Popola went back home. That made me
lonely, so I ran around singing songs as loud as I could.
But then that got kinda weird and scary, so I stopped. 
11930300	October 28

These black marks keep showing up on my body.
Sometimes I wonder if I'm gonna turn into a goblin or
something, but thinking about it makes my stomach hurt,
so I try not to.
11930400	December 1

In the book, the big tree kept on waiting and waiting.
I have to wait a lot, too. I wish I could do something.
11930500	January 30

Brother left pretty quick. He said he just stopped by so he
could see my face.
11930600	February 4

Once I finish my secret dish, I'm gonna feed it to Brother!
Then he'll see how helpful I can be!
11930700	March 16

The flower wasn't in any of Devola's books, so she
said I could name it whatever I want. Maybe I'll name it
after Brother!
11930800	August 31

I guess a Shade came near the village today.
People kept coming up to me and saying
"Boy, we sure wish your brother was around!"
And I said, "Me too! Brother could kick that Shade's butt!"
11930900	May 4

I wish brother would send me letters every day like I do.
But I know he's busy, so every other day is okay.
11931000	September 21

Today Devola said that Kainé is "put together in all the
right places." I dunno what all of that means, but I
wanna be like that when I grow up!

May god have mercy on us all.
12001000	Head to the library and get a new job from Popola.
12002000	Your work for Popola is done. It's time to go home.
12002500	Yonah seems to be missing. Maybe Popola might know something.
12003000	Head to the eastern gate, which leads to the Lost Shrine that Yonah mentioned.
12004000	You found Yonah's ribbon at the eastern gate. She must have left the village!
12011000	Yonah went to the Lost Shrine. Track her down before something happens.
12012000	Yonah has to be somewhere inside the Lost Shrine...
12013000	During battle, a talking book named Grimoire Weiss appeared.
12014000	You managed to save Yonah, but now dark markings have appeared on her body...
12021000	Yonah has been infected with the Black Scrawl. If you don't come up with some way to save her...
12022000	You heard Devola sing about a white book that can save the world. Talk to Popola to learn more.
12023000	According to Popola, you may be able to save Yonah by defeating Shades and obtaining their Sealed Verses. You decide to set out in search of these verses.
12031000	According to reports, Shades have been appearing in The Aerie with some frequency. Go there and see if the villagers know anything about the Sealed Verses.
12032000	It doesn't seem like there are any Sealed Verses here. Return to Popola to see if she has any ideas about what to do next.
12033000	On your way back, you noticed a strange wreath of flowers at a house near the exit. When you approached it, a woman appeared and a battle ensued.
12034000	The woman's name was Kainé. People say she's been possessed by a Shade.
12041000	A horde of Shades has appeared in The Aerie. Hurry to the village to check up on Kainé.
12042000	The giant Shade has returned. Kill it and claim its Sealed Verse.
12043000	With the Shade defeated and her grandmother avenged, Kainé agrees to travel with you in search of a new life.
12051000	Yonah received a letter from a mysterious admirer. Head for the manor in the southern plains to find out more.
12052000	Kainé has gone missing, but finding her will have to wait. First, you must seek out whoever sent the mysterious letter.
12053000	Search the manor for a cure to Emil's condition.
12054000	Emil's eyesight is still cursed, but he promised to discover the key to a cure.
12061000	You met a pair of brothers who live near the Junk Heap. Enter the mountain and find materials for them to sell.
12062000	You gave the materials you found to the brothers. It should be sufficient enough for them to keep working for a while longer.
12071000	You need flour, yeast, butter, and milk in order to bake bread for the Junk Heap brothers. Go and see if those items are sold in the village.
12072000	You delivered the finished bread to the brothers. It was different from their mother's, but they seemed satisfied nonetheless.
12081000	The younger brother, distraught that his mother is still missing, won't stop crying. Head back inside the Junk Heap and search for her.
12082000	After defeating a giant robot, you found the bodies of a man and a woman. The boys' mother had apparently abandoned her sons in order to run off with her lover.
12091000	Head to Seafront and find a shaman fish for Popola.
12092000	Ask around town until you learn how to catch a shaman fish.
12093000	A cranky old woman wants you to get the post office to deliver her mail.
12093500	You delivered the old woman's letter.
12094000	The postman of Seafront has a personal request for you.
12094500	You were asked to deliver a letter for the injured postman. Bring the letter to the old woman in the lighthouse.
12095000	You delivered the letter. The lighthouse lady doesn't look very well...
12095500	The cranky lighthouse lady is bothering the Seafront postman again. Go see if you can help.
12096000	You were asked to persuade the lighthouse lady to stay at her post. It's hard to drum up much enthusiasm for this...
12096500	The lighthouse lady doesn't have long to live. Convince the postman that she should be allowed to leave.
12097000	Return to the post office and try to reason with the postman one more time.
12097500	The letters to the lighthouse lady were all written by the postman, and now he's given you a new one. Should you tell her the truth, or...?
12098000	Telling the lighthouse lady the truth would have broken her heart. But did you make the right choice...?
12098500	Telling the lighthouse lady the truth would have broken her heart. But did you make the right choice...?
12099000	The Seafront postman wants to discuss something with you.
12099100	The lighthouse lady has died. You can only hope she was happy at the end. 
12101000	The town of Facade has cut off all contact with the outside world. Find a way inside.
12102000	Apparently Kainé is able to enter Facade freely, although she won't say how.
12103000	A girl named Fyra has volunteered to show you around.
12104000	Thanks to Fyra, you were able to order a water filter.
12105000	Deliver the water filter to Popola.
12111000	The water filter is ready. Head to Facade and pick it up.
12112000	Change of plans—now you must aid the prince of Facade. Fyra will guide you to the Barren Temple.
12113000	You successfully rescued the prince of Facade.
12114000	The prince is now king. With Rule Zero in place, the town is sure to see prosperous days again.
12121000	Yonah is running out of medicine. Venture to the southern gate and find some vapor moss.
12122000	Shades have invaded the village where you and Yonah live. You must stop them and keep Yonah safe!
12123000	The day is lost. Grimoire Noir has defeated your party, and Yonah has been stolen away. Worse yet, Emil was forced to petrify Kainé to keep a monstrous Shade entombed in the library's basement. Stricken by grief, you swear to free them all, no matter what the cost.
12131000	Five years after Yonah was taken, the world has changed.
12132000	Popola has a letter for you. Visit her and see what it's about.
12133000	The letter is from Emil, who wants to talk to you about Kainé. Go pay him a visit.
12141000	Go see Emil to discuss Kainé's condition.
12142000	Emil has discovered something called the Planning Room which may allow him to control his powers. Head for the inner courtyard and find the room's entrance.
12143000	Deep inside the Planning Room, you defeated a weapon known as Number 6. The event transformed Emil into a monster, but also granted him control of his powers.
12151000	Five years ago, Kainé had herself petrified in order to entomb a Shade. You now have the ability to rescue her.
12152000	Kainé's curse has been lifted, and the sealed Shade defeated. You and your friends are overjoyed to see her alive and well.
12153000	According to Popola, it's possible to reach the Shadowlord's lair from the Lost Shrine. The old path is gone, but you can use a boat to reach an alternate road near the river. Find this road and go rescue Yonah.
12161000	You received a letter announcing the grand re-opening of Two Brothers Weaponry.
12162000	The older brother died four years ago, leaving the younger to run the shop alone. Collect the materials he needs to create a new weapon.
12163000	The younger brother asked you to defeat the Shade that killed his sibling, along with the giant robot that accompanies it. Search for them deep inside the Junk Heap.
12164000	The Shade and the giant robot have been defeated. The brother's revenge is complete.
12171000	Find a path in the Lost Shine that leads to the Shadowlord's lair.
12172000	Kainé, wounded in battle, was taken over by a Shade named Tyrann that possesses her body. After a struggle, she managed to regain her consciousness before it was lost forever.
12173000	You found a doorway at the altar, but it was locked by a secret code. Ask Popola for a way to crack the code.
12181000	You received a wedding invite from the king of Facade.
12182000	A pack of wolves crashed the wedding ceremony, killing Fyra as she tried to protect the king. You should leave him to mourn for now...
12183000	The king has chosen to fight the wolves and avenge the death of his beloved. Rush to Facade and give him whatever aid is required.
12184000	You defeated the wolves' pack leader and avenged Fyra.
12191000	Strange things are happening in The Aerie. Stop by while on Popola's errand and see what's going on.
12192000	Some of The Aerie's villagers have been possessed by Shades. In the midst of the chaos, Kainé was attacked by a Shade.
12193000	As you fought the giant mass of Shades, Emil lost control of his power and destroyed The Aerie.
12201000	You now have all the required keys. Make your final preparations and then head to the Lost Shrine.
12202000	Using the keys, you opened a path from the altar to the Shadowlord's lair.
12211000	You've finally arrived at the Shadowlord's castle. The time has come to get Yonah back!
12501000	A merchant in the shopping district has asked you to hunt some sheep. Collect three pieces of mutton in the northern plains and bring them back to the client.
12502000	You gave the mutton to the client. Report back to Popola to complete the job.
12503000	You reported your success to Popola.
12511000	Popola has sent you on an herb-gathering mission. Search the northern plains for two medicinal herbs and bring them back to her.

12512000	You gave the medicinal herbs to Popola.
12521000	A guard at the northern gate asked you to deliver a message to the blacksmith's wife.

12541000	Popola has a job is for you in the shopping district. Visit the tool shop to find the client.

12542500	One witness remembered seeing eggs near the fountain by the library.
12543000	You found an egg. Bring it back to the item shop.
12543500	You told the client where the eggs are located.
12551000	A woman in green near the fountain in the shopping district has asked you to collect ten pieces of mutton.
12551500	You collected the mutton. Bring it back to the client.

13104000	You found the treasure, but it turned out to be worthless. Report back to the client's wife.

13133000	The Shade was reportedly in front of the library.
13133200	There was no Shade to be found. The girl is giving you conflicting statements. Ask some other villagers for clues.
13133400	Apparently the girl has been telling you lies. Go back and confront her about it.

13228400	The letters to the old lady were fakes written by the postman. How should you explain this to the woman?
13229400	You gave the letter to the lady and told her the truth.
13228500	You gave the letter to the lady, but decided not to tell her the truth.
13228600	You received word from the Seafront postman. Apparently he has something to tell you.
13229600	The old woman has passed away. Was it better this way? Who can say?
14000000	The carnage begins! No idea
where I am or why...yet.
14000100	Building strength by killing
these dark, creepy...things.
14000200	An unstable voice cries out
in an unstable world...
14000300	Suddenly in the...future?
Or is this the past? Hmm...
14000400	Hunting for mutton now?
This seems oddly MMO-esque.
14000500	Vast plains, blue skies...
and white, fluffy sheep.
14000600	Apparently I'm a freelance
errand boy. Yippee.
14000700	Out shopping. The people of
this world seem very poor...
14000800	Headed home to see my sister.
Sister?
14000900	This world is awful gloomy,
but at least it seems safe.
14001000	Taking on some crepuscular
foes. Go on, look it up.
14001100	Finished taking out the trash.
That was an ordeal...
14001200	Returning home after a day
of running back and forth.
14001300	My sister's gone. First,
the mutton, now this...
14001400	Nothing good can come from
a missing sister.
14001500	Searching for my sister.
This can't end well.
14001600	Operation: Sister Quest
continues. Where is she?
14001700	Still searching for Yonah.
Now I'm near a giant tree.
14001800	Those creatures are all over,
but still no sign of Yonah...
14001900	There she is! ...How can she
sleep at a time like this?
14002000	Just defeated a pair of iron
knights. Nothing's easy...
14002100	My sister's cursed, her body 
covered with black symbols... 
14002200	What did that girl do to
deserve this fate?
14002300	So THAT'S the objective of
this game. Very clever.
14002400	Crossing the plains. This is
taking forever.
14002500	Exploring a strange town built
into the side of a cliff.
14002600	Stumbled upon a trashy little
shack just outside town. 
14002700	Who's this girl, anyway? She's
wearing nothing but underwear.
14002800	Underwear Girl's fighting a
lizard. This is nuts...
14002900	So I just need to gather all 
the [SPOILER], right? Great!
14003000	Got the first [SPOILER]!
14003100	[SPOILER] is [SPOILER]. Is it
[SPOILER], or [SPOILER]? Hmm.
14003200	Off on a field trip to get my
weapon powered-up.
14003300	Looking for work in the
tavern. A man's gotta eat.
14003400	Off to the Junk Heap to try
and find some stuff to kill.
14003500	My sister's sick, and I'm
kinda freaking out.
14003600	Shh. I'm off looking for fish.
...Don't ask.
14003700	Ran across a whiny old lady.
At least Shades don't talk...
14003800	Delivering letters, running
fetch quests...the usual.
14003900	Time to head back to Underwear
Girl's village.
14004000	Fighting a giant, magical-ball
shooting lizard. So. Awesome.
14004100	Battle's over, but I still
gotta save Underwear Girl!
14004200	Heading for the desert. Better
brush up on my sign language.
14004300	Some guy's been sending mail
to my kid. Not too thrilled.
14004400	Underwear Girl got lost in a
haunted manor. Great.
14004500	Found a boy with a blindfold
playing the piano. Um, yeah.
14004600	Finally got out of that manor.
Time for a visit home.
14004700	The Junk Heap's still humming.
...I kinda wish it wasn't.
14004800	Fought a tin robot, a tin box,
and a tin pipe. Tin-acious!
14004900	Two brothers asked me to find
their mom. I hope she's okay.
14005000	That was unfortunate. Reality
can be pretty rough sometimes.
14005100	That was depressing. Can't
always have a happy ending...
14005200	At a lovely seaside town,
searching for fish.
14005300	Who knew I'd be fishing this
thing out of the sea myself?
14005400	Time to bring Yonah her meds.
I hate to see her suffer...
14005500	That old battle-axe needs our
help. She's a real pain...
14005600	Got a letter for the old lady.
Am I being punished?
14005700	Finished helping the old lady.
Hope she's happy now.
14005800	Finished helping the old lady. 
Wonder what her guy was like?
14005900	Desert? Check. Wolves? Check.
Weird masked people? ...Check.
14006000	In a weird town full of sand.
The people here are crazy.
14006100	Rules, rules, rules, rules!
What a pain in the [SPOILER]!
14006200	I could never, EVER live here.
Seriously, I'd die.
14006300	Caught up in a plot to save
the prince of crazytown.
14006400	Crazy prince saved. Crazytown
pleased. I'm outta here.
14006500	Some kind of...dream?
What the heck is going on?
14006600	Dreamdreamdreamdreamdream
dreamdreamdreamdreamdream
14006700	Villagers in a nightmare...
They're tormenting me...
14006800	That village was a nightmare.
Kinda like this game!
14006900	Heading home for the first
time in a while!
14007000	It's getting worse. What did
she do to deserve this pain?
14007100	I need medicine for Yonah.
Otherwise...
14007200	Seems like this is the calm
before the storm...
14007300	Giant creatures are attacking
the village. This is bad!
14007400	The screams of the dead and
dying echo throughout.
14007500	Enemies in the library. Must
protect my sister!
14007600	Five years have passed.
14007700	Our world is falling apart.
14007800	Time to visit the blindfolded
kid at his creepy manor.
14007900	Searching for a secret room.
Everything's a secret here...
14008000	I don't think anything could
surprise me at this point.
14008100	...Okay, that was surprising.
14008200	That...that was a heck of a
price to pay, wasn't it...
14008300	Beating an enemy senseless.
Get down and stay down!
14008400	Discrimination blows.
14008500	Heading back to where it all
began. I've come full circle.
14008600	Off to brain some more robots
at the ol' Junk Heap.
14008700	Back to the nightmare forest.
Maybe someday I'll understand.
14008800	Would any letters come to a
house in which no one waits?
14008900	I need some leads. Time to go
seek out more info.
14009000	Off to see the Junk Heap
brothers. It's been a while.
14009100	Wandering through iron caverns
in a mechanized paradise.
14009200	I wonder what the surviving
robots are thinking?
14009300	Off to pick up the new weapon.
Should make life a bit easier.
14009400	Trying out the new weapon.
Hope machines don't feel pain!
14009500	Fighting an insane machine.
This whole world's insane...
14009600	Back to the point of origin
yet again.
14009700	Fighting a foe that refuses
to give up the ghost.
14009800	Underwear Girl's gone berserk.
This is bad.
14009900	All the answers I seek lie
beyond this altar...
14010000	Returning to a lonely home.
A letter awaits.
14010100	Received an invitation from
the king of Facade.
14010200	Having a nice, peaceful chat.
It's about time.
14010300	Echoing screams. Streams of
blood. A future lost...
14010400	Keeping a promise to destroy
the wolves.
14010500	Man vs. wolf. Who will emerge
victorious?
14010600	For everything I gain, I lose
something more precious.
14010700	Back to the strange cliffside
village. Something's up.
14010800	Everyone's friendly. Too
friendly. I don't trust them.
14010900	I KNEW this was coming.
How infuriating.
14011000	A battle against chaos.
Who's in the right?
14011100	Everything's in place.
It's time to end this tale.
14011200	My sister awaits in the
last bastion of the enemy.
14011300	Into the Shadowlord's castle.
What an incredible sight.
14011400	Taking on the final boss.
The journey's almost over!
14011500	Half a cookie never tasted
better.
14011600	Ah gods, what a choice. All
paths lead to heartbreak...
14011700	A world draped in despair.
My tale begins...
14011800	Wandering through the desolate
lands. Today and always.
14011900	Taking a little break...
14012000	Currently idle.
