		1	1	0	NV_ID_0656					-1	0	0	0		Relinquishing the axe, her grandmother picked up a long pole with wooden buckets on either end. <STOP>Gathering water was by far the more difficult of the two jobs, but Kainé knew better than to complain. Once Grandma's mind was set, there was no changing it.
1312	1313	1	1	0	NV_ID_0660					-1	0	0	0		Kainé did her best to help with chores, but Grandma took every task that required travel to the village. <STOP>Though she had a long list of plausible excuses, Kainé knew the real reason: She didn't want her granddaughter to be taunted and harassed by the villagers. 
1313	1314	1	1	0	NV_ID_0661					-1	0	0	0		Once Kainé moved in, Grandma decided to take up residence a good distance from The Aerie. <STOP>Out of sight, out of mind seemed to be the best policy when it came to the villagers and her granddaughter, and rare were the days when any but the two of them could be found on the rocky acre of land they called home.

1315	1316	1	1	0	NV_ID_0668					-1	0	0	0		She suddenly understood the joy her grandmother felt in a good curse. <STOP>Happier now, she picked up the axe, forced it from the wood, and resumed chopping.

1318	1319	1	1	0	NV_ID_0679					-1	0	0	0		Kainé steadied the bucket with a foot as she knelt by her grandmother. A small bit of water sloshed over the side and made a new home in the hem of her dress, but Kainé didn't notice.

		1	1	0	NV_ID_0693					-1	0	0	0		The old woman watched as Kainé strapped on her boots and made her way down the road to the village. <STOP>Hours later, as an unseen sun made its way across a dark and rainy sky, she was still watching.
1322	1323	1	1	0	NV_ID_0697					-1	0	0	0		Kainé moved at a brisk pace, checking her pockets every few minutes to make sure the money her grandmother gave her was still there. <STOP>Every noise caused her to spin on her heels, making sure she wasn't being stalked by a Shade—or worse, Dimo and his gang. 
		1	1	0	NV_ID_0698					-1	0	0	0		But she encountered neither tormentors nor Shades, and Kainé finally found herself at the entrance to the village. <STOP>The few adults she could see glanced sideways at her, then muttered to each other behind raised hands before slinking away into the shadows. 
1323	1324	1	1	0	NV_ID_0699					-1	0	0	0		Her heart racing, Kainé took a series of rapid, shallow breaths and tried to calm herself.

		1	1	0	NV_ID_0706					-1	0	0	0		She chanted those words to herself over and over as she slowly made her way. <STOP>Finally, her eyes settled on a rotund older woman who was angrily waving her arms in the air and telling anyone who would listen exactly what she thought of Kainé's presence.<PAGE>
		1	1	0	NV_ID_0707					-1	0	0	0		"Hey, lady," said Kainé with a bravado she did not feel. "Where's the apothecary?"
		1	1	0	NV_ID_0708					-1	0	0	0		The woman's flabby cheeks shook in bewildered anger. <FONT=ITALIC>How dare this...this</FONT> thing <FONT=ITALIC>speak to me!</FONT> they seemed to say. But Kainé saw that her eyes held a different emotion: fear.

1325	1326	1	1	0	NV_ID_0710					-1	0	0	0		"Which way?" Kainé repeated.
		1	1	0	NV_ID_0711					-1	0	0	0		The woman pointed at a small building to her right before hitching up her dress and stumbling off in the other direction. <STOP>Kainé cringed, expecting a stone to come flying from the assembled crowd, but none came.
		1	1	0	NV_ID_0712					-1	0	0	0		Her mind was filled with a strange sense of pride as she made her way to the apothecary. But the new emotion had little time to take root, for as soon as she opened the door, she noticed a familiar customer at the counter.
1326	1327	1	1	0	NV_ID_0716					-1	0	0	0		It was Dimo. He'd clearly been sent here on some kind of family errand, because his gang of followers was nowhere to be found.

		1	1	0	NV_ID_0718					-1	0	0	0		The insult was delivered without force, and Kainé happily ignored it. Stretching on tiptoes to see over the counter, she asked the shopkeeper for the medication.<PAGE>
		1	1	0	NV_ID_0719					-1	0	0	0		"Ha!" barked Dimo. "That old bitch finally keel over!?"
		1	1	0	NV_ID_0720					-1	0	0	0		"Go to hell, Dimo!"
1327	1328	1	1	0	NV_ID_0721					-1	0	0	0		The boy's eyes grew so wide they seemed ready to fall out of his head. But before he could let fly a comeback—or worse, a punch—the apothecary told them to knock it off before he kicked them out of the store.
1328	1329	1	1	0	NV_ID_0725					-1	0	0	0		Dimo slunk out of the shop, cursing Kainé under his breath. <STOP>Once he was gone, she allowed herself to breathe once more, taking a brief tour of the shop while the owner prepared her medication.
		1	1	0	NV_ID_0726					-1	0	0	0		Countless tiny bottles filled the cramped store, each with a label written in some indecipherable language. An ocean of aromas assaulted her nose, creating a scent that was exotic, but not altogether unpleasant. <STOP>Seeing such a variety of supplies gave Kainé a sense of peace. Surely, in a world so vast, there would be a place that she could call home.
1329	1330	1	1	0	NV_ID_0727					-1	0	0	0		On the far wall, behind the counter, rested a portrait of a stunning young girl. <STOP>The picture had once contained bright, vibrant colors, but time had worked its magic, and they were beginning to fade. The beauty of the work, however, remained undiminished.
		1	1	0	NV_ID_0728					-1	0	0	0		"You like that picture?"
		1	1	0	NV_ID_0729					-1	0	0	0		Kainé turned to find the apothecary with a small vial of medicine in his hand. His eyes were gentle but sad, and they seemed to stare through her and into nothing as he spoke.

		1	1	0	NV_ID_0731					-1	0	0	0		Kainé didn't know how to respond; she just stared at the portrait and tried to come up with the right words.
1330	1331	1	1	0	NV_ID_0732					-1	0	0	0		"Pictures are wonderful things," continued the shopkeeper. "They let the ones closest to you live on forever."
		1	1	0	NV_ID_0733					-1	0	0	0		He shook his head slightly, then looked down at Kainé and smiled. Handing her the medicine, he reached into his sizeable green apron and produced a handful of old wax crayons.

1331	1332	1	1	0	NV_ID_0736					-1	0	0	0		"Yes, I've heard the rumors about you," he said. "It's a small village, and word travels quickly. <STOP>Between you and me, I'm not sure which of them to believe...but I also don't think they matter much. <STOP>I knew your grandmother Kali, and I think the way she was driven out of this town is just deplorable."<PAGE>
		1	1	0	NV_ID_0737					-1	0	0	0		<FONT=ITALIC>Grandma's name is Kali?</FONT> thought Kainé suddenly. <STOP>She was still mulling this new fact over in her mind as she reached out and gently took the crayons from the apothecary's hands.
		1	1	0	NV_ID_0738					-1	0	0	0		"Your grandmother is an old friend of mine," he said as Kainé scooted away yet again, "and I owe her much."
1332	1333	1	1	0	NV_ID_0739					-1	0	0	0		"I'm willing to wager that she would like it if you drew a picture of her. <STOP>Yes, I think she would like that very much."<PAGE>
		1	1	0	NV_ID_0740					-1	0	0	0		Kainé murmured a quiet agreement, but inside her heart was bursting. Never before had a villager treated her with anything but complete contempt. <STOP>It was a tiny, almost imperceptible step, but it was a step nonetheless—and with enough tiny steps, she might one day discover the rest of the world.
1333	1334	1	1	0	NV_ID_0744					-1	0	0	0		When Kainé returned home, she found her grandmother asleep in her bed. Her feet were blackened and raw—even bleeding a bit in places—leading Kainé to think that she had been pacing around the room until exhaustion finally caught up with her.
		1	1	0	NV_ID_0745					-1	0	0	0		She placed the medicine by her grandmother's pillow and turned to leave, but found the old woman's hand clasped around her arm.<PAGE>

		1	1	0	NV_ID_0749					-1	0	0	0		"It was kinda fun," said Kainé with a small smile. <STOP>"No, seriously, it was."
		1	1	0	NV_ID_0750					-1	0	0	0		"It was fun, was it?" asked her grandmother in a voice which implied she believed anything but.

		1	1	0	NV_ID_0752					-1	0	0	0		As she spoke, Kainé removed the crayons from her pocket. After a brief explanation of their source, she informed her grandmother that she was going to sketch her portrait.
1335	1336	1	1	0	NV_ID_0753					-1	0	0	0		"A portrait of me? Ridiculous. No one wants to stare at a wrinkled old crone."

		1	1	0	NV_ID_0755					-1	0	0	0		"Horse manure!" said her grandmother, throwing back the sheet from her bed. "Livin' forever would just piss me off. Now put those crayons away and help with dinner!"

1336	1337	1	1	0	NV_ID_0761					-1	0	0	0		Just as her grandmother was about to nod off, Kainé finished the work. After staring at it for a bit, she released it from her grip and let it slowly drift to the floor.

1388	1389	1	1	0	NV_ID_0995					-1	0	0	0		Kainé grabbed a nearby shard of glass and tried to saw off the Shade-infected portion of her side. <STOP>Before she could, her darkened left arm grabbed her right wrist, crushing it.

1391	1392	1	1	0	NV_ID_1009					-1	0	0	0		Kainé considered this as she struggled to her feet, the power of the Shade coursing through her. <STOP>The smoke from her house was drifting away with the wind, and she enjoyed the way the cool evening breeze felt on her new left arm.<PAGE>

1394	1395	1	1	0	NV_ID_1026					-1	0	0	0		Kainé waited until she was sure the voice was gone, then waved her new left arm around a few times. <FONT=ITALIC>It feels perfectly normal,</FONT> she thought. <FONT=ITALIC>It feels...like mine.</FONT> <STOP>Desperately, she began poking and prodding at the new limb, determined to find something wrong with it. <STOP>She didn't want it to feel normal.
